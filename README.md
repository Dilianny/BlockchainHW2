# Description
This program tries to crack sha1 hashes and salted sha1 hashes by using dictionary attack in python version 2.7.15.
It cracks salted sha1 hashes where the salt term is concatenated before hashing with another word to produce the salted hash 
# Instructions
	
	1.Download sha1hash.py and 10-million-password-list-top-1000000.txt  files to Desktop folder
	2.Then open command prompt for Window users
	3.Execute command "cd Desktop"
	4.Once directory is succefully changed execute command: "python sha1hash.py [hash]" for sha1 hash or execute command: "python sha1hash.py [hash] [salt term]" for salted sha1 hash.
